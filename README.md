This is a chess game created from scratch during my time in Auckland, New Zealand.

To play a game, navigate to the "final_version" folder and select the "play against human" file if you would like to play against another person, or the "play against machine" file if you would like yo play against the computer.

If playing against a human, within the "play against human" file, simply run it and a chess board should appear. To move, click on the piece you want to move, then click on the square you want to move it to. If you have selected an illegal move, there will be a message the pops up in the command window saying, "Illegal move, try again." Note that you must wait for the piece to move on the board until you select the next move.

To play against the computer, within the "play against machine" file, simply run the file. In the command window, a promt will show up asking you to select which color you want to play with. To select white, enter "w", if you would like to select black, enter "b". A pygame window will then apear that you must select. If you selected black, the computer will imediatly start calculating the first move, otherwise, play the first move and good luck!

The game currently works using an evaluation function combined with a Monte Carlo Search Tree. Due to limitations of my computer, the tree only has a depth of one.

I am currently working on improving the evaluation function, and creating a minimax search tree to improve the engine. Have fun!
